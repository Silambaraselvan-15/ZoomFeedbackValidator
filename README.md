# Zoom Feedback Validator

This Gradio-based web app uses a fine-tuned BERT model to validate whether a feedback comment matches a selected reason. It’s designed for classifying text-reason pairs in feedback data (e.g., Zoom meetings or product reviews).

## Features

* Accepts a piece of feedback and a selected reason
* Uses a fine-tuned BERT classifier to predict if they match
* Interactive web interface built with **Gradio**
* Returns "Matched" or "Not Matched" based on model prediction

## Demo

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.7+
* PyTorch
* Hugging Face Transformers
* Gradio
* pandas

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/zoom-feedback-validator.git
cd zoom-feedback-validator
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Add model and data**

* Place your fine-tuned model in a folder called `feedback_model/` (must be in Hugging Face format).
* Add the evaluation dataset as `eval.csv` in the project directory.

  The CSV should follow this format (no header in original file):

  ```
  feedback_text,reason,label
  ```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
python app.py
```

Or, if it's all in one script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## File Structure

```
zoom-feedback-validator/
│
├── feedback_model/         # Folder containing fine-tuned BERT model
├── eval.csv                # Evaluation dataset with feedback and reasons
├── app.py                  # Python script containing Gradio app
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Example Usage

Enter:

* **Feedback Text:** "The breakout rooms were very helpful."
* **Reason:** "Breakout Rooms"

The app will return:

* **"Matched"** if the model thinks the reason fits the feedback.
* **"Not Matched"** otherwise.
